# NETWORK OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: http_port
#	Usage:	port [options]
#		hostname:port [options]
#		1.2.3.4:port [options]
#
#	The socket addresses where Squid will listen for HTTP client
#	requests.  You may specify multiple socket addresses.
#	There are three forms: port alone, hostname with port, and
#	IP address with port.  If you specify a hostname or IP
#	address, Squid binds the socket to that specific
#	address.  This replaces the old 'tcp_incoming_address'
#	option.  Most likely, you do not need to bind to a specific
#	address, so you can use the port number alone.
#
#	If you are running Squid in accelerator mode, you
#	probably want to listen on port 80 also, or instead.
#
#	The -a command line option may be used to specify additional
#	port(s) where Squid listens for proxy request. Such ports will
#	be plain proxy ports with no options.
#
#	You may specify multiple socket addresses on multiple lines.
#
#	Options:
#
#	   intercept	Support for IP-Layer interception of
#			outgoing requests without browser settings.
#			NP: disables authentication and IPv6 on the port.
#
#	   tproxy	Support Linux TPROXY for spoofing outgoing
#			connections using the client IP address.
#			NP: disables authentication and maybe IPv6 on the port.
#
#	   accel	Accelerator mode. Also needs at least one of
#			vhost / vport / defaultsite.
#
#	   allow-direct	Allow direct forwarding in accelerator mode. Normally
#			accelerated requests are denied direct forwarding as if
#			never_direct was used.
#
#	   defaultsite=domainname
#			What to use for the Host: header if it is not present
#			in a request. Determines what site (not origin server)
#			accelerators should consider the default.
#			Implies accel.
#
#	   vhost	Accelerator mode using Host header for virtual domain support.
#			Also uses the port as specified in Host: header unless
#			overridden by the vport option. Implies accel.
#
#	   vport	Virtual host port support. Using the http_port number
#			instead of the port passed on Host: headers. Implies accel.
#
#	   vport=NN	Virtual host port support. Using the specified port
#			number instead of the port passed on Host: headers.
#			Implies accel.
#
#	   protocol=	Protocol to reconstruct accelerated requests with.
#			Defaults to http.
#
#	   ignore-cc	Ignore request Cache-Control headers.
#
#	   		Warning: This option violates HTTP specifications if
#			used in non-accelerator setups.
#
#	   connection-auth[=on|off]
#	                use connection-auth=off to tell Squid to prevent
#	                forwarding Microsoft connection oriented authentication
#			(NTLM, Negotiate and Kerberos)
#
#	   disable-pmtu-discovery=
#			Control Path-MTU discovery usage:
#			    off		lets OS decide on what to do (default).
#			    transparent	disable PMTU discovery when transparent
#					support is enabled.
#			    always	disable always PMTU discovery.
#
#			In many setups of transparently intercepting proxies
#			Path-MTU discovery can not work on traffic towards the
#			clients. This is the case when the intercepting device
#			does not fully track connections and fails to forward
#			ICMP must fragment messages to the cache server. If you
#			have such setup and experience that certain clients
#			sporadically hang or never complete requests set
#			disable-pmtu-discovery option to 'transparent'.
#
#	   ssl-bump 	Intercept each CONNECT request matching ssl_bump ACL,
#			establish secure connection with the client and with
#			the server, decrypt HTTP messages as they pass through
#			Squid, and treat them as unencrypted HTTP messages,
#			becoming the man-in-the-middle.
#
#			When this option is enabled, additional options become
#			available to specify SSL-related properties of the
#			client-side connection: cert, key, version, cipher,
#			options, clientca, cafile, capath, crlfile, dhparams,
#			sslflags, and sslcontext. See the https_port directive
#			for more information on these options.
#
#			The ssl_bump option is required to fully enable
#			the SslBump feature.
#
#	   name=	Specifies a internal name for the port. Defaults to
#			the port specification (port or addr:port)
#
#	   tcpkeepalive[=idle,interval,timeout]
#			Enable TCP keepalive probes of idle connections.
#			In seconds; idle is the initial time before TCP starts
#			probing the connection, interval how often to probe, and
#			timeout the time before giving up.
#
#	If you run Squid on a dual-homed machine with an internal
#	and an external interface we recommend you to specify the
#	internal address:port in http_port. This way Squid will only be
#	visible on the internal address.
#
#

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
http_port 3128

# MEMORY CACHE OPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mem	(bytes)
#	NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS SIZE.
#	IT ONLY PLACES A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MEMORY SQUID WILL
#	USE AS A MEMORY CACHE OF OBJECTS. SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER
#	THINGS AS WELL. SEE THE SQUID FAQ SECTION 8 FOR DETAILS.
#
#	'cache_mem' specifies the ideal amount of memory to be used
#	for:
#		* In-Transit objects
#		* Hot Objects
#		* Negative-Cached objects
#
#	Data for these objects are stored in 4 KB blocks.  This
#	parameter specifies the ideal upper limit on the total size of
#	4 KB blocks allocated.  In-Transit objects take the highest
#	priority.
#
#	In-transit objects have priority over the others.  When
#	additional space is needed for incoming data, negative-cached
#	and hot objects will be released.  In other words, the
#	negative-cached and hot objects will fill up any unused space
#	not needed for in-transit objects.
#
#	If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
#	Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
#	'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
#	exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
#	decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
#	reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
#	objects.
#Default:
#cache_mem 256 MB
cache_mem 32 MB

#  TAG: coredump_dir
#	By default Squid leaves core files in the directory from where
#	it was started. If you set 'coredump_dir' to a directory
#	that exists, Squid will chdir() to that directory at startup
#	and coredump files will be left there.
#
#Default:
# coredump_dir none
#

# Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
coredump_dir /var/spool/squid3

#  TAG: refresh_pattern
#	usage: refresh_pattern [-i] regex min percent max [options]
#
#	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
#	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.
#
#	'Min' is the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit
#	expiry time should be considered fresh. The recommended
#	value is 0, any higher values may cause dynamic applications
#	to be erroneously cached unless the application designer
#	has taken the appropriate actions.
#
#	'Percent' is a percentage of the objects age (time since last
#	modification age) an object without explicit expiry time
#	will be considered fresh.
#
#	'Max' is an upper limit on how long objects without an explicit
#	expiry time will be considered fresh.
#
#	options: override-expire
#		 override-lastmod
#		 reload-into-ims
#		 ignore-reload
#		 ignore-no-cache
#		 ignore-no-store
#		 ignore-must-revalidate
#		 ignore-private
#		 ignore-auth
#		 refresh-ims
#
#		override-expire enforces min age even if the server
#		sent an explicit expiry time (e.g., with the
#		Expires: header or Cache-Control: max-age). Doing this
#		VIOLATES the HTTP standard.  Enabling this feature
#		could make you liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		Note: override-expire does not enforce staleness - it only extends
#		freshness / min. If the server returns a Expires time which
#		is longer than your max time, Squid will still consider
#		the object fresh for that period of time.
#
#		override-lastmod enforces min age even on objects
#		that were modified recently.
#
#		reload-into-ims changes client no-cache or ``reload''
#		to If-Modified-Since requests. Doing this VIOLATES the
#		HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-reload ignores a client no-cache or ``reload''
#		header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard. Enabling
#		this feature could make you liable for problems which
#		it causes.
#
#		ignore-no-cache ignores any ``Pragma: no-cache'' and
#		``Cache-control: no-cache'' headers received from a server.
#		The HTTP RFC never allows the use of this (Pragma) header
#		from a server, only a client, though plenty of servers
#		send it anyway.
#
#		ignore-no-store ignores any ``Cache-control: no-store''
#		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
#		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-must-revalidate ignores any ``Cache-Control: must-revalidate``
#		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
#		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-private ignores any ``Cache-control: private''
#		headers received from a server. Doing this VIOLATES
#		the HTTP standard. Enabling this feature could make you
#		liable for problems which it causes.
#
#		ignore-auth caches responses to requests with authorization,
#		as if the originserver had sent ``Cache-control: public''
#		in the response header. Doing this VIOLATES the HTTP standard.
#		Enabling this feature could make you liable for problems which
#		it causes.
#
#		refresh-ims causes squid to contact the origin server
#		when a client issues an If-Modified-Since request. This
#		ensures that the client will receive an updated version
#		if one is available.
#
#	Basically a cached object is:
#
#		FRESH if expires < now, else STALE
#		STALE if age > max
#		FRESH if lm-factor < percent, else STALE
#		FRESH if age < min
#		else STALE
#
#	The refresh_pattern lines are checked in the order listed here.
#	The first entry which matches is used.  If none of the entries
#	match the default will be used.
#
#	Note, you must uncomment all the default lines if you want
#	to change one. The default setting is only active if none is
#	used.
