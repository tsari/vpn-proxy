# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports

#  TAG: coredump_dir
#	By default Squid leaves core files in the directory from where
#	it was started. If you set 'coredump_dir' to a directory
#	that exists, Squid will chdir() to that directory at startup
#	and coredump files will be left there.
#
#Default:
# coredump_dir none
#

# Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
coredump_dir /var/spool/squid3
